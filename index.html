        <h1>Birth of a king</h1> 
        <h2>By, Maurice Brown</h2>
        
        <p> <strong>Forefathers</strong> young and old <br> Bear witness to the birth of a <em>king</em> <br> Sing his name with praise and <strong>jubilation</strong> <br> So that even in the swords in <em>Valhalla</em> look down <br> In awe for a new warrior <em>destined to join their ranks</em> <br> May our voices carry to the throne of the <strong>All Father</strong> <br> So he may grant our king his wisdom <br> May the other <strong>Gods</strong> come to give their blessing <br> May <Strong>Thor</Strong> grant him strength <br> May <strong>Tyr</strong> steady his sword hand <br> And may <strong>Freyja</strong> Calm his heart.
